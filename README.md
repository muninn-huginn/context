# The Context Flow Manifesto

A theoretical framework exploring how context flows through networks of humans and machines, shaping organizational velocity and effectiveness.

## Overview

The Context Flow Manifesto presents a mathematical and theoretical foundation for understanding how context quality, distribution efficiency, and human interaction affect the velocity of work in modern organizations. It introduces formulas and principles that describe the relationship between context flow and organizational performance.

## Key Concepts

- **Context Quality (C)**: Measures the completeness and accuracy of context (0 ≤ C ≤ 1)
- **Distribution Efficiency (D)**: Represents how effectively context flows through the network (0 ≤ D ≤ 1)
- **Human Interaction Coefficient (H)**: Quantifies engagement and contribution levels
- **Network Effects**: Describes how value compounds through participant interaction

## Core Equations

The manifesto introduces several key equations:

V = C × D × H × K × (1 + r)^t

Where:
- V represents system velocity
- C represents context quality
- D represents distribution efficiency
- H represents human interaction coefficient
- K is the base capability coefficient
- r is the learning rate
- t is time

## Structure

The manifesto includes:

1. Mathematical Truth
2. The Human Element
3. The AI Bridge
4. The New Economy
5. The Compounding Effect
6. Appendix: Organizational Context Systems

## Viewing

The manifesto is presented as a single HTML page with embedded styles. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the content.
